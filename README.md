# tf2cfg
A TF2 config made by Random_Guy_23 to disable unnecessary features that use up a lot of GPU.
Basically, it's mastercoms without the weird `_c` shit

Notepad++ is highly recommended for editing this, so please get it

## WARNING
If there is a feature that you do not want (ex. Ragdoll removal), then insert a comment (//) in front of the commands that you don't want.

Also, if you are removing Mastercoms's config to install this, make sure to follow the uninstallation guide.

>If you have already have a config, or want to remove mastercomfig, delete any configs you may have in tf/custom and delete the tf/cfg folder. Then verify your game files using Steam.

>Next, if you have Steam Cloud Synchronization enabled, make all the files in STEAM_FOLDER/userdata/USER_ID/440/remote/cfg blank. Do not delete them, or else Steam Cloud will redownload them. Alternatively, you can disable Steam Cloud.

>Finally, launch TF2 with only the -novid -default -autoconfig +host_writeconfig +mat_savechanges +quit launch options. The game will launch and exit. Afterwards, remove these launch options.

## Installation
[Download the latest release,](https://github.com/random-guy-23/tf2cfg/releases/) download the .zip, and drag the `autoexec` file to `SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/custom`, if you don't have a `custom` folder, then why are you here? Search up a guide on Google or something. 

If you already have a `autoexec` folder in your `custom` folder, then just copy&paste the stuff in my `autoexec` and paste it at the bottom of yours.
