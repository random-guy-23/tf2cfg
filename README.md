# tf2cfg
A TF2 config made by Random_Guy_23 to disable unnecessary features that use up a lot of GPU.
Also it has some of my infamous binds.

Notepad++ is highly recommended for editing this, so please get it

## WARNING
If there is a feature that you do not want (ex. Ragdoll removal), then insert a comment (//) in front of the commands that you don't want.

## Installation
[Download the latest release,](https://github.com/random-guy-23/tf2cfg/releases/) download the .zip, and drag the `autoexec` file to `SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/custom`, if you don't have a `custom` folder, then why are you here? Search up a guide on Google or something. 

If you already have a `autoexec` folder in your `custom` folder, then just copy&paste the stuff in my `autoexec` and paste it at the bottom of yours.
